# Interview Search

## Description
This is a tool for searching in the [hiring-without-whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) list.

It's intended to find openings that match the technologies I use, but why not make it dynamic and share it on github?

The app goes thru all the links in the hiring-without-whiteboards list, gets all the buttons and links that correspond to the criteria, like 'job', 'listing', 'apply', etc and in all the links it finds it starts searching for the terms for the wanted technolgies, 'python', 'pandas', 'docker', etc.

The search is case insensitive and it's achieved with puppeteer.
